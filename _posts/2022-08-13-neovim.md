# What is and why neovim?

Here's a pretty well-written treatise on [why Vim needs improvement](https://geoff.greer.fm/2015/01/15/why-neovim-is-better-than-vim/).

Features above Vim:
 * Asynchronous script running (meaning scripts can run as you are editing).
 * Lua scripts for addons and config.
 * Richer addon library: addons are supposed to be easier, so it seems like more devs produce addons for Neovim.

# Install instructions

Neovim probably isn't default on your machine. 
I've walked the route of compilation from scratch, and found it wasn't so hard. 

My install script is in `setup/install_neovim.sh` in [my github dotfiles](https://github.com/bbusemeyer/dotfiles).
