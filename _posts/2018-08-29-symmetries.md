excerpt: Symmetries can be indispensable for creating compact representations of a Hamiltonian.
---

Symmetries of a Hamiltonian (and many matrices, for that matter) are exceptionally useful tools for efficient and sparse representations. 
In model fitting, we use these symmetries to dramatically reduce the number of fit parameters.

[These notes]({{ "/assets/pdfs/symmetries.pdf" }}) discuss the basics of symmetries and the Hamiltonian.
