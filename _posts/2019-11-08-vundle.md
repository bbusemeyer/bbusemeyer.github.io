Vundle is a tool for adding functionality to VIM.
It allows you to add and update plug-ins for VIM.

Going to the [github for bundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and follow the instructions in Quick Start in the `README.md`.
I found it worked without errors for me, except that `:h vundle` did nothing.

Adding `:PluginInstall syntastic` worked to install [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic), also [see here]({% post_url 2019-11-08-syntastic %}).
You can then check on what things are installed using `:PluginList`. 

Pretty pleased with how easy it was!
