This research page is a collection of notes, tips, and research goodies that I've collected during my studies. 
I'm reconstructing it, since the old repository I was using broke with some updates. I'll probably simplify things. Stay tuned!

## About me

<img align="right" src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" width="200" style="margin: 0px 10px" />

I'm a Flatiron Research Fellow at the [Center for Computational Quantum Physics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-quantum-physics) in the Flatiron Institute. 
I've been studying transition metal compounds through the lens of computer simulations since my undergraduate days of 2011. 

My current work focus on generating copious amounts of data using detailed diffusion Monte Carlo simulations, then applying statistical and data science techniques to wrangle the results into something interesting.
Check out my [resume]({{ "/assets/pdfs/resume_2018.pdf" | absolute_url }}) for more details.

Besides work, feel free to chat with me about biking, history podcasts, algorithms, badminton, rock climbing, running, and playing drums.
